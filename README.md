##What's Countly?

Countly is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. 
It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze 
mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: 
the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data 
(for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry). Both parts are open source.
